2 1/4 cup flour
3/4  cup potato starch
1/2 cup dark chocolate
1 cup extra virgin olove oil
2 cups honey
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water

Add the ingredients in the order described above and mix well.  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 degrees for 23 minutes.  This will ensure that you have a nice greasy layer of burnt fudge on top.  Gobble it all up while it's still hot and mushy.  Enjoy!
